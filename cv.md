I want to become a Junior Frontend-Developer, So I always practice with JS, HTML/CSS, create some landing, resolve task on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard?h_r=logo), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Debruit/completed_solutions) and read tutorials.

I know JavaScript, Jquery,HTML,CSS,GIT, just a little bit Ionic Framework, W3C, BEM, adaptive and responsive HTML coding,

Anyway You can look my examples on my [GitHub.](https://github.com/Vseuvoleny)

You have graduated Samara State unvercity on Sociological Faculty. But in Frontend Development I read [JS tutorial](https://learn.javascript.ru) and "Eloquent JavaScript", take some exercise on [HTML Academy](https://htmlacademy.ru) and doing some task(test task, landing etc.)
